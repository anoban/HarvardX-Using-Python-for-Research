## _**This repository contains Pyhton scripts and Jupyter notebooks associated with the courseware.**_
**Since I did not have the idea of making a github repository for this course when I was following the course, the materials are pretty unorganized and contains rough scripts I made when practicing and answering homeworks. So do not expect this to be perfect (in fact it is not even close to "good"). I'm uploading this here just as a backup dump for myself. But I thought I'd make it public in case any one doing this course desparate & patient enough to scourge anything valuable out of this may find this useful. lol**
